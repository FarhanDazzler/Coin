    "text": "A process should be put in place to ensure all manual journal entries are pre-approved by the authorized people. The evidence of those approvals should be archived and the completeness of pre-approvals should be verified as part of the detective control over manual journal entries.<br/>All MJEs in ERP systems (any manual transaction whereby a person determines both Debit & Credit account and the amount to be posted) are reviewed for accuracy and validity at the moment of request by capable and independent senior employees.<br/>The approver should ensure that the person requesting the manual journal entry is authorized to do so, the entry is in line with the Accounting & Reporting Manual or other management reporting guidelines, the supporting material and calculation behind the entry is available and accurate, necessary DAG approvals are in place (if applicable).<br/>Exception procedure for journal entries where system does technically not allow park & post (as validated by Global Internal Control) :<br/>- the reviewer in the detective control will perform the tasks assigned to approver above post-factum.<br/>- the detective control is executed before or on WD10.<br/>- on top, quarterly, the list of people with direct access to post (without park) is reviewed and confirmed."
